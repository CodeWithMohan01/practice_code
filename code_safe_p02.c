// Ashu and Arvind participated in a coding contest, as a result of which they received NN chocolates. Now they want to divide the chocolates between them equally.

// Can you help them by deciding if it is possible for them to divide all the NN chocolates in such a way that they each get an equal number of chocolates?

// For each test case output the answer on a new line â€” "Yes" (without quotes) if they can divide chocolates between them equally, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise
